                    The <strong>div</strong> element is used as a container that divides an HTML document into sections and is short for “division”. The div elements can contain <em>flow content</em> such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc.

                    The anchor element is used to create hyperlinks in an HTML document. The hyperlinks can point to other webpages, files on the same server, a location on the same page, or any other URL via the hyperlink reference attribute, <strong>href</strong>.

                    The unordered list element is used to create a list of items in no particular order. Each individual list item will have a bullet point by default.

                <td>Line Break</td>
                <td>
                    The line break element will create a line break in text and is especially useful where a division of text is required, like in a postal address. The line break element requires only an opening tag and must not have a closing tag.

                <td>Span</td>
                <td>
                    The span element is an inline container for text and can be used to group text for styling purposes. However, as span is a generic container to separate pieces of text from a larger body of text, its use should be avoided if a more semantic element is available.

                <td>
                    The strong element highlights important, serious, or urgent text and browsers will normally render this highlighted text in <strong>bold</strong> by default.

                <td>
                    The emphasis element emphasizes text and browsers will usually <em>italicize</em> the emphasized text by default.

                <td>Image</td>
                <td>
                    The image element embed images in documents. The <strong>src</strong> attribute contains the image URL and is mandatory. The image element is an <em>empty element</em> meaning it should not have a closing tag.
                </td>

            <tr>
                <td>&lt;video&gt;</td>
                <td>Video</td>
                <td>
                    The video element embeds a media player for video playback. The <strong>src</strong> attribute will contain the URL to the video. Adding the <strong>controls</strong> attribute will display video controls in the media player.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> The content inside the opening and closing tag is shown as a fallback in browsers that don’t support the element.

                    The HTML input element is used to render a variety of input fields on a webpage including text fields, checkboxes, buttons, etc. The input element have a type attribute that determines how it gets rendered to a page.

                <td>
                    The text area element is used when creating a text-box for multi-line input (e.g. a comment section). The element supports the <strong>rows</strong> and <strong>cols</strong> attributes which determine the height and width, respectively, of the element.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When rendered by the browser, the text area fields can be stretched/shrunk in size by the user, but the <strong>rows</strong> and <strong>cols</strong> attributes determine the initial size.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Unlike the input element, the text area element has both opening and closing tags. The value of the element is the content in between these tags (much like a paragraph element).

                    The HTML select element can be used to create a dropdown list. A list of choices for the dropdown list can be created using one or more <strong>option</strong> elements. By default, only one <strong>option</strong> can be selected at a time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The value of the selected <strong>select</strong>’s name and the <strong>option</strong>’ s value attribute are sent as a key-value pair when the form is submitted.

                <td>
                    When using an HTML input, a basic search/autocomplete functionality can be achieved by pairing an input element with a datalist element. To pair a <strong>input</strong> with a <strong>datalist</strong> the <strong>input</strong>’s list value must match the value of the id of the  <strong>datalist</strong>. The datalist element is used to store a list of <strong>option</strong>s.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The list of data is shown as a dropdown on an <strong>input</strong> field when a user clicks on the input field. As the user starts typing, the list will be updated to show elements that best match what has been typed into the input field. The actual list items are specified as multiple <strong>option</strong> elements nested inside the <strong>datalist</strong>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>datalist</strong> are ideal when providing users a list of pre-defined options, but to also allow them to write alternative inputs as well.

                <td>
                    The HTML label element provides identification for a specific <strong>input</strong> based on matching values of the <strong>input</strong>‘s id attribute and the <strong>label</strong>‘s for attribute. By default, clicking on the <strong>label</strong> will focus the field of the related <strong>input</strong>.

                    The HTML input elements can support text input by setting the attribute <strong>type="text"</strong>. This renders a single row input field that users can type text inside.

                    <br>
                    The value of the <strong>input</strong>‘s name and value attribute of the element are sent as a key-value pair when the form is submitted.

                <td>
                    When using an HTML input element, the <strong>type="checkbox"</strong> attribute will render a single checkbox item. To create a group of checkboxes related to the same topic, they should all use the same name attribute. Since it’s a checkbox, multiple checkboxes can be selected for the same topic.

                <td>
                    A slider can be created by using the <strong>type="range"</strong> attribute on an HTML input element. The range slider will act as a selector between a minimum and a maximum value. These values are set using the <strong>min</strong> and <strong>max</strong> attributes respectively. The slider can be adjusted to move in different steps or increments using the step attribute.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The range slider is meant to act more as a visual widget to adjust between 2 values, where the relative position is important, but the precise value is not as important. An example of this can be adjusting the volume level of an application.

                    The HTML input element can have the attribute <strong>type="password"</strong> that renders a single row input field which allows the user to type censored text inside the field. It is used to type in sensitive information.

                    <br>
                    The value of this <strong>input</strong>’s <strong>name</strong> and <strong>value</strong> (actual value and not the censored version) attribute of this element are sent as a key-value pair when the form is submitted.

                    HTML input elements can have a type attribute set to submit, by adding <strong>type="submit"</strong>. With this attribute included, a submit button will be rendered and, by default, will submit the <strong>form</strong> and execute its action.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The text of a submit button is set to <strong>Submit</strong> by default but can also be changed by modifying the <strong>value</strong> attribute.

                <td>
                    In order for a form to send data, it needs to be able to put it into key-value pairs. This is achieved by setting the <strong>name</strong> attribute of the <strong>input</strong> element. The <strong>name</strong> will become the <strong>key</strong> and the <strong>value</strong> of the input will become the <strong>value</strong> the form submits corresponding to the key.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It’s important to remember that the name is not the same as the ID in terms of form submission. The ID and the name of the input may be the same, but the value will only be submitted if the <strong>name</strong> attribute is specified.
